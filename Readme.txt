Part 4: Save/Load Map

This is assignment is about being able to read a .map extension.
It is composed of 3 parts : [Map], [Continents] and [Territories].
While there are still lines in the file, the reader iterates throughout all of them
in order to store the values in a C++ object. After every objects from every line has been created,
The map will contain a list of all the continents and the continents will contain all the territories. 
This is the first part consisting of being able to read a map file. 

Now, all the objects are available and ready to be used by the system and the user. 

After the system or user is done with game, he can choose to export all the map information to an external file,
that will be used in the future. It does not store the game information and states but only the map, the continents
and the territories that are present in the game. The user can choose the name of the file he wishes to save to.
Since it was developped as a component, it will be easily incorporated into the main driver.
