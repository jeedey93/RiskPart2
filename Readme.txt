Part 3: Interactive Map Editor

This is assignment is about being able to read a .map extension and edit a .map extension.
Furthermore, the user should be able to create a map from scratch and save it to a .map file extension.
It is a follow up from assignment#1, where it was save/load maps.
It is still composed of 3 parts : [Map], [Continents] and [Territories].

The user starts and has 2 options : Create or Edit a map.
If he chooses Create, he will be prompted a menu to do all sort of stuff such as Create new countries, create territories, define adjacent territories, and finally save his work.

If he chooses Edit, he will be able to load a map file then apply changes to it.

At the end, before saving the map into an external file, the system will validate the map,
which means it will make sure no continents has the same name and no territories shares the same name.
